### **Question:** What were the initial challenges and blockers you faced? 

**Pranit:** Initially, I faced several challenges such as lack of basic knowledge and difficulty in finding resources.

I overcame these challenges by finding out relevant cybersecurity books, bug bounty and CTF write-ups which improved my skills.
