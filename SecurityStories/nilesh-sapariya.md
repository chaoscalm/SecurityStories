Through the SecurityStories series, Today, we are excited to bring forward the story of Nilesh Sapariya, a highly skilled penetration tester from India who currently resides in UAE. So let's jump straight into learning more about him and from his experience. 

### **Question:** Could you briefly introduce yourself? 

**Nilesh:** I am Nilesh Sapariya, and I have worked in cybersecurity for the past ten years. My primary area of expertise is application security. However, I am always eager to learn new things. Despite having a decade of experience in my field, I still consider myself a beginner. The cyber security domain is vast and ever-evolving, making it exciting and challenging to stay ahead of the curve. 

I am an active member of the cybersecurity community (Null), engaging in bug bounty, CTF, and other security-based activities. In addition, I am part of the Cobalt Core and Synack Red Team, helping to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. Doing good and helping each other are essential to our success. 


### **Question:** How did you get started in Cyber Security?

**Nilesh:** When I was in 2nd year of engineering, our college got an invitation from a nearby college with multiple events organized. One of the events was "Ethical Hacking," which fascinated me a lot, and without a second thought, I decided to participate. In this event, the speaker presented two laptops and demonstrated how he gained access to the other laptop from his machine via some graphic representation. I am still unable to figure out how he did that, but this particular demonstration was the turning point of my life, and I decided to dive deep into it. After completing my engineering, the journey was rock bottom. It's not easy for everyone to get a job with a low academic score in engineering.

I was one of them. I applied for jobs, attended many walk-in interviews, and got my first job in the networking field as a network engineer. I knew this was not my path, and my mind was still on ethical hacking. I used to work from 9 am to 6 pm (we did not have Saturday and Sunday off). I utilized my post-working hours to study ethical hacking and started researching it. I still remember reading the theory and trying to visualize how virtual machines work to set up Kali Linux, and then I started practising. Finally, after learning for all these years, my hard work paid off.

I reported a vulnerability in Microsoft and got into their Hall of Fame list. That's it. Then the journey of becoming an ethical hacker started. After that, I never looked back. I got many halls of fame in top-notch organizations. During this period, I got invitations from various top engineering colleges in Mumbai (India) to conduct workshops on Ethical Hacking. I decided to share this knowledge without any monetary reward to help beginners. I have undertaken many talks at various colleges, which can be found here. So, with this knowledge, skills, and many HOF, I got my first job in Cyber Security in 2013.


### **Question:** What were the initial challenges and blockers you faced? 

**Nilesh:** Initially, I faced many challenges and blockers when starting my cyber security career. I needed to figure out where to start or what to read and which path to follow. I had to go through a lot of trial and error before finding my footing. I did a lot of research and dedicated a lot of time to understanding the basics of cyber security, learning the different tools and techniques, and developing my skillset.

I had to take a lot of risks and also face a lot of failures before I eventually found success. However, I overcame the initial challenges and blockers through dedication, hard work, and perseverance and became a successful cybersecurity specialist. All thanks to the people who supported me during this journey, including my mentors, and obviously, god's grace is a must. 



### **Question:** What is the learning methodology you followed or still follow? 
**Nilesh:** The learning methodology I have followed for cyber security combines self-learning and hands-on experience via the PortSwigger lab. I have been researching and reading about the different concepts and tools used in cybersecurity and also attending online courses and workshops. Additionally, I have been participating in online CTFs (Capture the Flag) to develop my skills.


### **Question:** What all certifications do you hold, and what certificates would you recommend to the readers? 

**Nilesh:** I currently hold several certifications in cybersecurity, including 

- Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
- Offensive Security Wireless Professional (OSWP)
- Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)
- Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) v8
- Certified Blockchain Expert
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500)

Readers should select a certification in the area of cyber security that is most suitable for their goals. For instance, the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification is popular for those specialising in offensive security. In contrast, the Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP) certification suits those interested in red teaming.


### **Question:** What is your favourite thing to hack on?

**Nilesh:** I like exploring all targets: web applications, APIs, mobile, networks, etc. But if I want to pick the best target, it will always be "web application".
